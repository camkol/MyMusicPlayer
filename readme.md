## My process

- In the project's HTML structure, the main content is housed within an index.html file, featuring a container division that holds the music player and playlist components.
- These components are styled using CSS defined in a styles.css file, which customizes various aspects like font styles, colors, and layout properties.
- The interactive behavior of the music player is managed through JavaScript in a script.js file, which utilizes event listeners to handle song playback, navigation, and playlist management functions.
- The playlist data, containing details of each song, is stored in an array format within the JavaScript file, enabling dynamic song selection and rendering.
- Audio playback is controlled using the Audio object, allowing for play, pause, and track navigation functionalities.
- Together, these files and their associated code create a cohesive web application for playing and managing a music playlist, with an emphasis on responsive design and user interaction.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- Mobile-Responsive Design
- JavaScript - Scripting language
